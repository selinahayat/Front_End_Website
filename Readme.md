<h2> Project outline <h2>
<p>For this second assignment I was delegated the task of creating a website of my own preference where I decided I will create a website upon myself and my experiences through- out the years. The reason why I chose this theme was because all my previous website projects have been about something fiction and so this time I wanted it to be something personal and interesting. The website consists of html 5 elements, css and JavaScript. The website is aimed at everyone who is interesting knowing about my personal life and can do so. The website consists of three pages: home, profile and a gallery. Quite simply the website has a simple navigation architecture and the user can locate itself page by page via the navigation bar.</p>
